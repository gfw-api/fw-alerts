# FW alerts Microservice

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gfw-api/fw-alerts.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.com/gfw-api/fw-alerts)
[![Test Coverage](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/40d4b1e823a36f2041a4/test_coverage)](https://codeclimate.com/github/gfw-api/fw-alerts/test_coverage)

Gets the alerts of an area grouped by geohash precision

## Dependencies

You will need [Control Tower](https://github.com/control-tower/control-tower) up and running - either natively or with Docker. Refer to the project's README for information on how to set it up.

The FW alerts microservice is built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and can be executed either natively or using Docker, each of which has its own set of requirements.

Native execution requires:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Execution using Docker requires:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

Dependencies on other Microservices:
- [GFW Areas](https://github.com/gfw-api/gfw-area)
- [GLAD analysis athena](https://github.com/gfw-api/glad-analysis-tiled)

## Getting started

Start by cloning the repository from github to your execution environment

```
git clone https://github.com/gfw-api/fw-alerts.git && cd fw-alerts
```

After that, follow one of the instructions below:

### Using native execution

1 - Set up your environment variables. See `dev.env.sample` for a list of variables you should set, which are described in detail in [this section](#environment-variables) of the documentation. Native execution will NOT load the `dev.env` file content, so you need to use another way to define those values

2 - Install node dependencies using yarn:
```
yarn
```

3 - Start the application server:
```
yarn start
```

The endpoints provided by this microservice should now be available through Control Tower's URL.

### Using Docker

1 - Create and complete your `dev.env` file with your configuration. The meaning of the variables is available in this [section](#configuration-environment-variables). You can find an example `dev.env.sample` file in the project root.

2 - Execute the following command to run Control tower:

```
./fw-alerts.sh develop
```

The endpoints provided by this microservice should now be available through Control Tower's URL.

## Testing

There are two ways to run the included tests:

### Using native execution

Follow the instruction above for setting up the runtime environment for native execution, then run:
```
yarn test
```

### Using Docker

Follow the instruction above for setting up the runtime environment for Docker execution, then run:
```
./fw-alerts.sh test
```

## Configuration

### Environment variables

- PORT => TCP port in which the service will run
- NODE_PATH => relative path to the source code. Should be `app/src`
- CT_REGISTER_MODE => if `auto` the microservice automatically registers on Control Tower on start
- MICROSERVICE_TOKEN => 
- API_VERSION => API version identifier that prefixes the URL. Should be `v1`

You can optionally set other variables, see [this file](config/custom-environment-variables.json) for an extended list.


### Endpoints available

* /:datasetSlug/:geostoreId Get the alerts grouped by geohash precision 8 for GLAD or VIIRS

#### Query params
* `days` from now with the following default values:
    * GLAD: 365 (last year)
    * VIIRS: 7 (last data available)
* `output` json by default but also allowed csv format
* `precision` geohash precision to group by
